#Design Concepts

The concept for my design was making a web page that was easily navigable but also easy to read for the viewer.  
I accomplished this by sperating each section into columns so that I can make the width of each content section 
only about a few inches so that it is always within the readers view.  I also wanted to take the reader on a 
journey through the page which is why I am going to include some images and will seperate the participation and
benefits sections on opposite sides of the page.  I think that this will keep the reader engaged and also keep
the content width to a minimum reducing the need to scan the viewer's eyes across the screen.

Each section will have a well defined header and I plan to make these headings stand out using enlarged text.
I think that this design clearly seperates each section and I expect my users to remain engaged throughout their
experience by using larger headings and clearly seperating each section.  I also plan to break the page up using 
lines to seperate each section.  By doing this, I hope to only have one section viewable at a time on the readers
browser which will make the page seem much more digestible than just one really long document. 

My design was mostly inspired by http://csszengarden.com/215/  I think this page is beautifully designed and really
keeps me engaged throught the eperience.
